From time to time, Lab Cyber Security may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>
              <p>LabCyberSec also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on https://www.labcybersec.com blog posts. LabCyberSec only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.</p>

              <h2 class="title h2">Personally Identifying Information</h2>
              <p>Certain visitors to Lab Cyber Security’s websites choose to interact with Lab Cyber Security in ways that require Lab Cyber Security to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Lab Cyber Security gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who use the contact forms at https://www.lab.co.zw to provide a name and email address.</p>
              <p>Lab Cyber Security discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that:</p>

              <ul>
                <li>(i) need to know that information in order to process it on Lab Cyber Security’s behalf or to provide services available at Lab Cyber Security’s website, and</li>
                <li>(ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Lab Cyber Security’s website, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Lab Cyber Security will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Lab Cyber Security discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Lab Cyber Security believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Lab Cyber Security, third parties or the public at large.</p>
              <p>If you are a registered user of https://www.lab.co.zw and have supplied your email address, Lab Cyber Security may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with Lab Cyber Security and our products. We primarily use our blog to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Lab Cyber Security takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>
